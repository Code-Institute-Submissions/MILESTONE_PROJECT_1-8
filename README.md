### Testing User Stories from UX Section
**First Time Visitor Goals**
1. As a first time user, I would like to easily understand what this dj offers.
   * Upon entering, users are greeted with an eye-grabbing hero image of a couple kissing on a dancefloor, whith smiling guests around them.

   * On desktop devices there is also a container over the image with a tagline.
   ![tagline](/assets/readmeimages/tagline.PNG "tagline over main image")
   
2. As a first time user, I would like to easily navigate through the site's content.

   * When arriving at the site, the user has several options. In the top right corner of the page is the menu which navigates through the site.
     The colour of the text is white and the background purple indicating which page they are on.<br>
     ![homepage highlighted](/assets/readmeimages/menulist.PNG "landing page button styled to show which page you are on")<br>
     ![gallery highlighted](/assets/readmeimages/menupage.PNG "landing page gallery button styled to show which page you are on") 
   
   * Under the hero image is a strategically placed call to action button, encouraging couples to get in touch about discounts for midweek weddings. 

   * As Users scroll down the page, they see a welcome message and a little info about Limerick DJ.
   ![welcome message](/assets/readmeimages/welcome.PNG "welcome message on homepage")

   * There is also a link here to take them directly to the Gallery & Reviews page. 

3. As a first time user, I would like to check out the djs social pages.

   * On the fotter there are links to each of my business social pages which users can check out. These contain more videos and more up to date information<br>
   ![footer social](/assets/readmeimages/social.PNG "social icons on footer")


**Returning Visitors**

1. As a returning visitor, I would like to see up to date pictures and reviews.
   * The images in the gallery can be easily updated and up to date reviews added. 

**Frequent Visitors**

* As weddings are one off events I don't foresee visitors returning.

### Further Testing

* The website was tested on Google Chrome with dev tools and also Firefox browsers.
* I also used the Unicorn Revealer extension to check errors with columns.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad & Samsung mobile devices.
* There was an issue with the cover text on the hero image being in the wrong place, it was relative to the page. I changed this to be relative to the hero image and it works perfectly. 
* All the links on every page were tested on all browsers to ensure they are working properly.
* My family members were recruited to play on the site and inform me of any changes they felt needed to be made, look for mistakes and check all links worked as they should.
