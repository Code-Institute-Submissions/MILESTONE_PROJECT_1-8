**Returning Visitors**

1. As a returning visitor, I would like to see up to date pictures and reviews.
   * The images in the gallery can be easily updated and up to date reviews added. 

**Frequent Visitors**

* I also used the Unicorn Revealer extension to check errors with columns.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad & Samsung mobile devices.
* All the links on every page were tested on all browsers to ensure they are working properly.
* My family members were recruited to play on the site and inform me of any changes they felt needed to be made, look for mistakes and check all links worked as they should.
